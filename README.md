## Personal Website by Niklas Leon Kluge
### Welcome to my personal journey following my development at the Modern Japanese Program at Hokkaido University using Github and Jupyter Notebooks.

I am an undergraduate student at Hokkaido University, where I am enrolled in the Modern Japanese Studies Program (現代日本学プログラム課程).
Aside from broadening my knowledge of Japanese history, culture, economics, and politics, this course allows me to pursue and conduct research on personal interests. Specifically, how rural areas can be improved and revitalized, as well as how urban space can be more productively utilized, and how technology can aid in this process.

## About me 

After struggling to make the "correct" decision about what to study, I chose to spend a year working and traveling in New Zealand. What was supposed to be a one-year vacation, evolved into a seven-year adventure. I've always been captivated by foreign places, which I learned about through documentaries or found in my favorite novels, for as long as I can remember. During my travels in Japan, I came across several opportunities to interact with locals and collect narratives about Japanese rural life. During my time off I was able to work in various fields, for a range of NGOs and volunteer organizations.
In comparison to other places in Asia where I was able to gain a basic cultural knowledge by observing, I found it more difficult to grasp Japanese traditions, customs, and lifestyle, which attracted me and sparked my curiosity in learning more. This eventually led me to Sapporo, where I enrolled in Hokkaido University's MJSP program. 

In my spare time, I like to go trekking, spend time at home cooking and trying out new recipes or playing boardgames.
